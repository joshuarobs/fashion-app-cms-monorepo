This folder contains interfaces of the various tables found in the database
(Hasura).

As of writing (2021-1-20) there is no current way for WebStorm to work nicely
with Typescript, Graphql and Hasura at the same time.

To make coding more easier, we'll have to manually create an interface for each
of the tables in Hasura.

Any changes in Hasura will need to be reflected in the appropriate table file in
this folder.

If ever Graphql schemas (especially from Hasura) will work with Typescript, then
we can delete these interfaces, as that would be achieving the same thing, but
done automatically.

This is the workaround for now, so we'll have to deal with it manually.
